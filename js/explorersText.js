Which met a poor end in the Weddell Sea. The ship  was crushed in the ice flows and Shackleton and his crew were marooned miles from civilisation with only the supplies hastily recovered from the dying ship.</p>" +
      "<p>Despite the adversity Shackleton and his men suffered, all men on board including Shackleton himself survived this harrowing journey back to civilisation. After waiting some time a top the ice flows, the men eventually made their way to elephant island. However, this island proved to be too inhospitable and offered little chance of rescue. Shackleton then set off in an open top boat through unforgiving seas to reach the island of South Georgia and find refuge in a whaling station set up there. After landing on the wrong side of the island and travelling across the mountainous terrain. Shackleton and three of his companions found rescue. And immediately sent assistance to his awaiting men on Elephant Island.</p>",
